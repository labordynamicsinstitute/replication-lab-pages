Since his appointment as AEA Data Editor in early 2018, Lars Vilhuber has been preparing and implementing the new AEA Data and Code Availability Policy. This involves systematic checking of publications for

- data citations and data provenance descriptions ("Data availability statements")
- Availability of all data and code (as allowed by licensing and data use agreements)
- Computational reproducibility of the article's tables and figures, as well as of the data preparation code.
